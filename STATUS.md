# Talktofile — Current Status

**What is true right now.** Every section is **rewritten in place**, never appended to — if a feature
moves between not-started / in-progress / done, or gets reverted, edit its entry so this file always
describes the present. There are no dates and no history here; that's `CHANGELOG.md`'s job.

## Shipped — working today

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| **Auth** | Guest + registered (legacy JWT *or* Supabase). **Google** social sign-in live. Password reset works in both modes (Supabase-handled, or native single-use 30-min token via Resend). |
| **Upload & pipeline** | Single / multi / compare modes. Extract → index → summarize across PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, HTML, JSON, CSV, Markdown, text, and many source formats. Zero-text files are skipped (not fatal) in a multi-file batch. Once ready, the landing page drops the user straight into the section they picked (e.g. Slides) — no Proceed click. |
| **Chat** | Streaming Q&A over WebSocket with auto-reconnect, suggested questions, citation grounding. |
| **Tool sections** | Summary, Flashcards, Podcast, Slides, Translate, Charts — all six render and generate. |
| **Slides** | Designed decks: the AI picks from 10 layouts (cover, agenda, section divider, bullets, big numbers, comparison, process, cards, quote, closing) across 3 redesigned themes (Classic corporate / Minimal editorial / Bold dark keynote) + accent colour; the preview and the .pptx match. Pro sends more of each document to the model (10k vs 8k chars — `slides_context_chars` in `core/config.py`). Editable per layout (incl. switching a slide's layout), AI-refinable; free for all (Pro gate removed). Inline render + opt-in .pptx download that reuses already-generated slides. |
| **Chapters** | Segmentation + chapter-scoped summaries. Left doc panel filters to the selected chapters. |
| **Ops** | Plan limits, per-day usage caps, rate limiting, feedback capture, mandatory role personalisation at signup (`RoleOnboarding` → in-depth persona per role, free for all registered users), Dockerized production serving behind Caddy. |
| **SEO `<head>`** | Title, description, and OG image are in the raw HTML — social previews and search titles work. |
| **Use-case landing pages** | `/students`, `/research`, `/legal`, `/business` (plus the home page `/`) — same page, different hero copy, trust row, pre-selected mode, and (legal) a "Not legal advice" footer line. Data in `src/lib/landingVariants.ts`. Linked from a **"Use cases" dropdown in the navbar** (desktop only — the mobile navbar has no primary links). Each has its own `<title>`, description, canonical, OG/Twitter tags, an **FAQ section above the footer** and **FAQPage JSON-LD**, all **in the raw HTML**: the build writes `dist/<slug>.html` (Vite plugin in `vite.config.ts`, data in `src/lib/landingSeo.ts`) and Caddy serves `/students` from `students.html`. Listed in `sitemap.xml`. |

## In progress

Nothing is mid-flight. The last change was hero headline copy (now *"Make anything."*); the layout
constraint that governs it is documented in `CLAUDE.md` → Design / Brand.

## Not started — known gaps

**Stubbed in the UI, backend missing** — full specs in `TODO.md`, don't re-derive them:
- **Add a custom translation language.** The "+ Add new language" box exists but only flashes
  "Coming soon". Needs a validation endpoint plus a small frontend wire-up.
- **Continue an over-length translation.** Source is truncated at 14,000 chars; the "Continue"
  button is a no-op. Needs an **offset-driven** endpoint — explicitly *not* a conversational
  "continue".

**Not stubbed, simply absent:**
- **Real billing.** Pro is granted only via the `PRO_EMAILS` env var; there is no payment flow.
- **Persistence of chats/documents.** By design — sessions are in-memory and lost on refresh. A
  confirm dialog and a `beforeunload` guard mitigate accidental loss; there is no save/restore.
- **OCR.** Files with images are no longer rejected (the text layer is extracted, images ignored),
  but a fully scanned file has nothing to read. In a batch it's skipped; as a lone file it fails
  with a "run OCR first" message.
- **Chapter scoping beyond Summary.** The shared mechanism is built and meant to be reused. Extending
  it to Translate / Flashcards / Podcast / Slides means accepting `chapter_ids` in that tool's
  endpoint. **Charts is tabular** (different shape). **Chat is the biggest** — retrieval needs
  chunk-level chapter tagging, and chunks aren't tagged yet. Multi-document scoping currently targets
  the first document only.
- **Pre-rendered landing HTML (full page).** Low priority — **do this well after the blog has posts**,
  which is the bigger SEO lever. Partly done: each use-case page already gets its own `<head>`,
  JSON-LD and FAQ in the raw HTML (see *Shipped*), but the hero and the rest of the body are still
  client-rendered (React replaces `#root` on mount; no hydration). Decided approach for the rest: extend
  the **Vite plugin** in `vite.config.ts` to prerender the whole landing, with React hydrating it, so
  the in-place upload UX needs no refactor. (Rejected:
  an Astro rewrite — real refactor, since `Landing.tsx` couples marketing to the upload flow; and
  Next.js — a full rewrite for one page.) Guard SSR-unsafe code at snapshot time: `window`,
  `localStorage`, WebSockets, the theme script, PostHog.

**Easy wins, not yet taken:**
- An unused webfont (**Plus Jakarta Sans**) is still downloaded in `frontend/index.html` despite
  0 uses in `src/` — drop it from the Google Fonts `<link>` (keep **Inter**, the slides use it). Same for the unused `obsidian` / `cyan` palettes in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Parked on purpose — off, but not dead code

Do not delete these as cleanup; each is a one- or two-line restore. Restore instructions live in
`CLAUDE.md` → *Temporarily Hidden UI*.

- **Intro-offer promo splash** — off via `INTRO_OFFER_ENABLED = false` **and** a commented-out render.
  Both are required: the flag alone stops the timer from burning the once-a-day cooldown key.
- **Landing "Plans" section** — the whole `<section id="plans">` is commented out; `PLAN_FEATURES`
  still sits at the top of `Landing.tsx`.
- **Microsoft + LinkedIn sign-in** — commented out of `SOCIAL_PROVIDERS`. ⚠️ Code alone won't revive
  them; the `azure` / `linkedin_oidc` providers must also be configured in the Supabase dashboard.
  Google is unaffected and stays live.

---

## Dead code

- `src/components/WorkspaceComposer.tsx` — superseded by `SectionComposer`, imported nowhere. Safe
  to delete (unlike everything in *Parked* above).
